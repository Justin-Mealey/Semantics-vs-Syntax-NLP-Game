# Project Setup with uv

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package and project manager.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):

   [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Justin-Mealey/Semantics-vs-Syntax-NLP-Game.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   This will install all packages listed in `pyproject.toml` and set up a virtual environment automatically.

4. **Run the application** (replace with your entry point):

   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run main.py
   ```
